# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made my glitch art script pull random pictures before glitching them and started a script to modify them to create album art and headers.

**Thoughts:** Need to look more into automating gimp or figure out how to do all the important filters with a python module PIL or PILlow

**Link to work:** Not gonna use this on private projects. [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
