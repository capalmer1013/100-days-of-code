# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made my glitch art script pull random pictures before glitching them and started a script to modify them to create album art and headers.

**Thoughts:** Need to look more into automating gimp or figure out how to do all the important filters with a python module PIL or PILlow


### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some code to traverse lyrics and create probabilistic graphs, then generate original lyrics from this.

**Thoughts:** Need to standardize the graph and automate more of the mixing.



### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added some code for simplifying creating lyrics and raps. Now reading graphs from json file so that learned things can be persistent.

**Thoughts:** Need to add a way to combine multiple graphs.



### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: automated mixing tracks, improved the vocals by adding 4 seconds of silence to the begining.

**Thoughts:** need to break the spoken vocals into files of lines, then time when they are added by the tempo of the drum track.



### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started adding some code for automating the basslines

**Thoughts:**need to plan this out and get a high level view of this.


### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a first pass on my github.io page. Just put my resume on the about page.

**Thoughts:** I want to have a page that is kinda like a blog where I just post links to things I'm interested in and probably ramble about stuff.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a blog page to the github io page. total bullcrap just copied a bunch of links.

**Thoughts:** It gave me a lot of ideas about how to handle this website thing. ultimately I want to write a script to generate each of the pages and update the menu bar so that the the correct pages show up.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added a file to generate the blog file so that I don't have to write it by hand.

**Thoughts:** need to figure out how to generate this. if it is by some other file then it should probably have an associated state machine. or just interpret a json page or yaml.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a bunch of broken code to generate html.

**Thoughts:** using yaml files is dope. I just wrote it poorly.

### Day 9: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the broken code from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** need to make it more flexible to generate multiple pages.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: added some stuff to the generated code to try out some time

**Thoughts:** If this doesn't work then I need it to recurse into posts.

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: tested the code from yesterday. doesn't work the way I wanted

**Thoughts:** need to either figure out how yaml could recurse or do it myself. probably the second. kinda been lazy lately
